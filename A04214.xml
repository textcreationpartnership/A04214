            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>IVE me leaue I beſeech you (Fathers and Brethren right honorable &amp; beloved in Chriſt) in ſo great and neceſſary a caſe to reply and Defend my ſelfe in ſuch wiſe as becommeth me againſt the vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writings of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who indeed, I aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, in the world is far greater then I am. Yet forasmuch as the Cauſe which heere I maintaine is right and iuſt, as to any man I hope it ſhall ſoone appeare that will ſimply and ſoberly trie it by the Scriptures: Againe in regard of mine owne perſon and poore credit, although meane in the world, yet by Gods mercie ſuch as in conſcience I am bound by all honeſt and Chriſtian meanes to preſerue, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſo ſtrangelie traduceth &amp; accuſeth me in his booke as is almoſt incredible, I am therfore of neceſſitie (as I take it) to open my mouth at this time, and ſpecially in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of that doctrine, which I am vndoubtly perſwaded, for the ſubſtance of it, that hither vnto I with infinit mo in England haue truly &amp; faithfully taught. And albeit I finde my ſelfe very vnequall to try any queſtion with him, who is ſo high in authoritie, ſo prompt of witt, ſo exquiſit in learning, my ſelfe in all things ſo deſpiſed and rejected as I am by him and ſome others: inſomuch that I might iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be altogeather terrified and wholly turned away (were my cauſe neuer ſo good) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maintayning the ſame againſt him: yet ſurely, God is my witnes, it ſeemeth to mee ſo
<pb facs="tcp:3239:3"/>eaſy and ſo plaine to defend, togeather with the neceſſitie of duetie binding me (as likewiſe indeed all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> els I think) to ſtande therevnto, that I could not chooſe but ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in this matter, and cleere it againe ſo well as I can from his further weake exceptions, and vnſufficient obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt it. Neyther let any man thinke that in thus doing I greatly pleaſe my ſelfe, or ſeeme vnwilling to let others to vtter their iudgments heerevpon. Nay ſurely it is the thing that heerein chiefly I deſire, even that others, yea many others (if ſo it may ſeeme good vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) would declare their mindes touching this new doctrine ſprung vp from Wincheſter, and likely to bring a common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with other errors mo vpon our Churches in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, becauſe I feare that not a few among vs, are, &amp; wilbe troubled therewith. And ſo I doubt not but it will moſt amply appeare how Holy &amp; true a doctrine this is, which he ſo diſdainfully skoffeth at and reprocheth, beeing well aſſured that even the moſt learned and godly Teachers in this land, Defendours of the trueth againſt Poperie, as wel before time as now at this day vnder our gracious Queene, doe concurre &amp; agree with my opinion herein. This if it ſhall pleaſe God that I may ſee, it wil far more exceedingly pleaſe me to beholde, then whatſoever myne owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulnes hath or can vtter. In the meane while, I beſeech thee, Chriſtian Reader, conſider duly with thy ſelfe, not who ſpeaketh, but what is ſpoken by eyther of vs. As for me, I am not aſhamed to teſtifie with all duetie, though after my ſimplicitie, in the behalfe of the Goſpell of Chriſt againſt mens improbable conjectures: which my truſt is that the godly and ſober minded will take in good worth vprightly, even as my heart meaneth it (the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) ſincerely. The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bee with you all. Amen.</p>

               <hi>A Praeface to the Christian Readers</hi> touching our 2. Queſtions and their Defenſe following.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a iuſt thing with God (deare brethren) to puniſh in his diſſolute people ſinne with ſinne: and where one iniquitie is not repented, to binde others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. Which thing ſurely we may to well ſee is com to paſſe and befallen vs in England deſeruedly at this day. Who after ſo long, plentifull, and comfortable enioying of the Gospell (the most precious bleſſing of God in this life) are now all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt generally com to this, that we haue loſt the loue thereof. What remayneth then for vs, when we ſet ſo light by this Heauenly grace forgetting our firſt loue which once wee ſeemed to beare towards it, and wherein now wee ought to haue abounded, but that God ſhould puniſh this our hainous and generall ſinne with others, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſend vs deluſions euen ſtrong deluſions to broch &amp; beleeue lyes, ſeeing we ſhew ſo ſmall affection and ſo little pleaſure in his truth. The Lord in iuſtice then (no doubt) doth puniſh vs with ſuch deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of error as are now ſo rife in our land at this time, more then in times past when as the Gospell hath ben ſoundlyer preached and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloued among vs, then now it ſeemeth to bee. Now ſo much the more dangerous this miſchief is, as alſo it must needes proue yet ſtill, becauſe it is offered vnto vs forſooth by the frendes of the Goſpell, and fathers of the Church as they deſire to be called, yet being indeed ſole Commanders in Religion, very Lords ouer mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiuely ouerruling their brethren and Gods deare flocke; contrary to the<note n="“" place="margin">Mat and 2 2 Cor. 1. Cor. 1. Pet.</note> expreſſe Scripture, and all well ordred Ancient and preſent tymes. How needfull then is it that the Lords faithfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers forget not themſelues in theſe deceiptfull dayes, nor that great charge which the great Pastour of the Flock hath layd vpon them, but to bee watchfull and diligent and for no respect of perſons to ſuffer any part of the gracious truth of God to bee diſgraced by men: chiefly that part and point (if we can diſcerne what it is) which by the corruption thereof raiſeth and maintayneth moſt of our other vaine corrupt and contentious quaestions which now ſwarme among
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3239:4"/>vs, yet which eaſily would bee cut cleane downe if the word of God alone might beare ſway, as we ſee it to be brought to paſſe this day by the bleſſing of God in other Reformed Churches of forraine Countryes. For my part, being occaſioned at this time more ſpecially to ſpeak of <hi>2.</hi> of theſe foreſaid corrupt doctrines, J am not vnwilling (though vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually yoked) to defend the truth in them. It hath pleaſeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bilſon the now L. Biſhop of Wincheſter to begin among vs a new matter of faith neuer heard of before in England (but only in the dayes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery) touching the All ſufficiency of the meere Bodily Sufferings of Chriſt, and to maintaine an other which was neere worne out, of his going downe to Hell in Soule. In both which becauſe my conſcience aſſured mee that hee was much mistaken, and laboured that others ſhould mistake alſo, I thought it not beſides my duty (the Lord offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me opportunity) to maintaine the truth, and that in all plainenes and evidence of the Scripture as God inabled me with. This now a while ſince being publiſhed (wherein my truſt is I caryed my ſelfe no otherwiſe then J ought) the Author and maintayner of the contrary hath ſo of late intertayned it, as ſeemeth to mee and to many others wonderfull. Wonderfull, not for ſtrength of reaſons nor for exquiſit matter ſuch as neuer before was delivered, though his learning J acknowledge and will not but reverence his gifts: but wonderfull his anſwer is and altogeather extraordinary, conſidering that ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable bitternes, diſdaine, skoffing, reproch, and furious rage doth ſo abundantly com from him therein againſt my poore ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet by the mercy of God a true Chriſtian, a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and one (I praiſe the Lorde) which euer haue bin carefull to bee free from the ſcandalls of the World. Though heerein J boaſt not, but rather (with the Apoſtle) will boaſt of mine infirmities. Verily this now J haue learned by his writing better then euer I conceaued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; namely what great oddes he maketh and deſireth to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene himſelfe a Lord Biſhop, and an other being but a Preacher of Gods most holy word. Well: this is the Rhetorike and the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Concluſion againſt my treatiſe. But all this is beſides his Matter, which nevertheles may haue peradventure ſom weight in it. It may peradventure. Wherefore J ſee a double neceſſity vrging me to reply therevnto. Firſt to the end that his exceptions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (that is to ſay, his wholl matter) may appeare yet better to be ſo weake and vnſufficient as indeed they are. See: that thoſe vncivill
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3239:4"/>reproches (I will not ſay vnchristian revilings) being the bewty and forme of his booke, may appeare to be but the froth of a distempered ſtomacke, the colour of reaſon and iust cauſe which he casteth on it, being taken away. As touching the matter therefore thus I purpoſe to deale. I will begin with his later writing, which he calleth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, becauſe he mainly directeth it against mee, taking in by the way alſo all ſuch places &amp; points in the former Treatiſe as do right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerne our matter in hand. Finally, as touching his reproches and cruell words I intend wholy to paſſe ouer them, ſeeing for them neither is he any whit the better, nor my ſelfe the worſe.</p>

Sec: Chriſt having moſt horrible ſinnes imputed to him as the damned haue
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3239:7"/>alſo, therefore he ſuffered for them from Gods hand euen as the damned do: namely in theſe points, which are both poſſible and reaſonable, that is, paines inflicted <hi>immediatly and properly</hi> in the Soule, and not only by outward meanes in the Body.

                  <item>3.

Conſequently then he felt all the paines of the damned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3239:8"/>which were no ſinnes, neither indeed perpetuall: ſeeing his Divine nature could admitt this in his Manhood aſwell as any ſuffering at all for ſinne. You will ſay, If hee felt not alſo <hi>deſperation</hi> as the damned do, then hee felt not all the paines which the damned do feele: For <hi>desperation</hi> augmenteth their very paines. I anſwere, we ſay not that Chriſt ſuffered ſimply All the paines of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that is, He felt not ſuch as are by their very nature ſinnes aſwell as paines: as indeed <hi>desperation</hi> is. But I ſay Chriſt ſuffered none of thoſe paines. All other which are by their nature meere paines and onely painfull Chriſt did ſuffer them as ſharply for the time, we doubt not, as the very damned do. So that if your L. will ſtand to that which before we obſerued in you, and not clip it, not renounce it, we profeſſe this is all that ever we did or do craue, wee neede no longer to ſtriue, it is the wholl queſtion which you grant vs: viz: <hi>That Chriſt did beare puniſhment of ſinne as great as any is proceeding from the Justice of God, yet being no ſinne.</hi> Whence it muſt needes follow that the paines of Chriſtes ſuffering were the ſame in nature and altogeather as ſharpe and as painfull as they are in Hell it ſelf. And this is the whol ſumme of the matter about Chriſtes Helliſh ſorrowes and paines, &amp; thus ſtandeth our quaeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with theſe differences, according to which we hold and profeſſe that Chriſt ſuffered the Wrath of God, or Hell paines.</p>
            <p>If you ſet the queſtion otherwiſe, you go back from that which you found fault withall in your Sermons, &amp; you fully ioyne with the Preachers and Catechiſmes of England, yea withall other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the world; and namely with all them, whom at firſt you reproued and traduced openly for this cauſe.

               <hi>I am more bold then wiſe</hi> in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Scapegoat to ſignifie the Soule of Chriſt. Surely then I were like you, who affirme as <hi>boldly,</hi> that among the Iewes no Sacrifice at all foreſhewed any Suffering of the Soule of Chriſt: which you can never prove. Howbeit this I acknowledge indeed that the Iewiſh Figures, though they be applyable vnto Chriſt the ſubſtance of thoſe ſhaddowes, yet wee ought to apply them in the particulars ſoberly and warily, and not without ſome plaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Figure with the thing Figured. Wherefore my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3239:21"/>is none other in theſe Iewiſh figures, which the Scripture doth not any where expreſly interpret, but to ſhew what I thinke to be indeed moſt probable and likely, knowing that yet ſom ſuch matter, as we aime at, they do ſignifie without queſtion. And this is ſufficient to deny your Aſſertion, which againſt our ſaying that <hi>the ſufferings of Christes Soule may be ſignified by the Scapegoat,</hi> is but meerely coniecturall and preſumed.</p>
            <p>The very like are * your 3. reaſons brought to ſhew that the " <hi>Holocaust</hi> cannot ſignifie the ſuffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But this is a weake inference. Is there any Figure or ſimilitude concurring in all points and circumſtances with the thing ſignified? Sure there is no man of knowledge ſo vnexpert or ſo vnreaſonable as to require it. Many times where they agree only but in one principall reſpect, that ſufficeth to make the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. Againe many ſimilitudes and Figures there are in the olde Law having as great diſparageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the things ſignified by them as this in the <hi>Holocauſt</hi> which you talke of. The Bodies of beaſts firſt " ſlaine,<note place="margin">Lev. 4.11, 2. &amp; 16, 27 Heb 13.11.12. ver. 13. Lev. 1.9.</note> were <hi>after</hi> caryed out of the Hoſt.

Laſtly the * burning of the beaſtes <hi>after</hi> they were dead, was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a ſweet favour vnto God. Which in truth is Chriſts <hi>very " death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fphe. 5.2.</note> and nothing don by him afterward, whereby Gods anger is fully pacified towarde vs. Wherefore your firſt exception is very vaine. The 2. is like to it. The <hi>Holocaust was conſumed in one &amp; the ſame ſire. But Christ was tormented wholly not with one kind of ſuffering</hi> (as we maintaine) <hi>but with</hi> 2. <hi>kindes, that is with bodyly &amp; ſpirituall ſorrowes.</hi> Firſt I ſay, this alſo, if it were true, is as weake an exception as the former, and altogeather like it. See: Though Chriſt indeed ſuffered divers and ſundry kindes of ſorrowes yea even of thoſe which were meerely outward and bodily,<note place="margin">Even that meerely in the Soule viz. when it grew vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as alſo of thoſe that were meerely Spirituall and inward, yet we plainely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that <hi>one &amp; " the ſame</hi> torment afflicted his whole manhood by ſympathy.

He needed no Amendement, but that which he ſuffered was right Puniſhment. He was neyther in caſe as the wicked, nor yet ſimply as the godly. He differed from them both, and yet in ſom pointes did partake of both their conditions. He was like the godly, in that he was highly beloved of God, and had no maner of ſinne of his own laid to his charge. He was like the wicked and differed from the caſe of the godly greatly, becauſe he was laden &amp; charged with ſinnes, yea with all maner of ſinnes, &amp; ſuſtayned their due puniſhment,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3239:26"/>there being alſo none other at all to indure the vengeance of God for them but himſelfe. As we haue largely ſhewed before in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtate of our Queſtion. Thus then whatſoever Chriſt ſuffered (and ſpecially at his death) was very wrath and vengeance from God properly taken, true puniſhment and iuſtice executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne &amp; for ſinne, to the which he was in ſom ſort condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appointed, alſo this was the true Curſe of the Law which thus he ſuſtayned for vs. Nevertheles in all this his Caſe was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> his condition in the like puniſhments vtterly vnlike to the wicked. For his owne nature was ſtill for all this moſt holy, faithfull, ſtedfaſt, loving the Lord, and beloved of him, albeit in his office of Redeeming vs and ſuretyſhip for vs he did ſuſtaine truly, and not vnproperly, (as the Godly do) the Lordes very wrath againſt ſinne which he tooke vpon him. Heere is now the <hi>Power</hi> of God to be deepely conſidered, togeather with his vnſpeakeable <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Holines.</hi> Even one of the greateſt myſteries of Chriſtian Religion: which to vnfolde what toung is able, yea what heart can conceave it?

Only the ſenſe of the paine of Gods Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance came indeede vnto his moſt holy nature: the Curſe the Hatred, the wrath, and iudgment of God being quenched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. His owne nature felt the ſorrow and paine of the Curſe and Hatred. But the Hatred &amp; Curſe was bent againſt the load of our ſinne wherein he ſtood forth as guilty before God, and appeared as it were clothed therewith. This was Love and mercy to vs, this was Iuſtice vpon Chriſt having vndertaken for vs, this was infinit power and wiſdom both wayes in God to bring it to paſſe, which no creature can comprehend: his Holynes and Love ſtill chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Redeemed ones, but laying no part of true Puniſhment or proper Vengeance for ſinne vpon them, which Chriſt only did for them wholly ſuſtayne. Thus alſo ſeeing Chriſt indeed had no ſinne in him (as the godly have) to be corrected: neyther could be correctted &amp; chaſticed for nothing: therefore properly he was not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3239:27"/>chaſtiſed nor corrected at all, but his Afflictions every one both ſmall and great were true and proper puniſhments, and the effects of Gods very wrath for our ſinne lying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.<note place="margin">

So that my meaning is no more but to exclude that which you affirme, <hi>That Christ tooke his Humane Soule to ſuffer in it only from and by his Body.</hi> This heere I denyed, and nothing els. For I grant that Chriſt intended that his Humane Soule ſhould ſuffer by Sympathy: but yet alſo this he intended not directly nor primarily in taking the 2 diſtinct partes of our Humane nature our Soule and our Body. He intended it by conſequence, becauſe Natures right ſtate was ſuch in vs: therefore determining to be in nature like vs, he would alſo that his Soule ſhould feele the Bodyes outward harmes, as it doth with vs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in compariſon of the Soules moſt principall diſpoſition, &amp; of that which is proper to Reaſonable Creatures, he did not reſpect the inferiour part, that which is common to vs with Beaſtes, even this ſenſitive ſuffering by Sympathy with and from the Body. I ſay in compariſon of the other Chriſt reſpected not this, yet he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect this alſo, as I ſaid, ſecondarily &amp; conſequently: that is becauſe he intended to have our nature in whole and full perfection, as we have it, only except ſinne. Now I beſeech you would any vpright adverſary obiect againſt me, that in this ſpeach I exclude <hi>Christes doing righteouſnes in his Soule for vs &amp;c.</hi> I appeale to all indifferent Readers. Rather hence we are to gather &amp; to conclude, that each part in Chriſt ought to have the proper and immediat vſe as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the nature thereof, aſwell in ſuffering, as it is cleere that it hath in working righteouſnes. In Chriſtes working of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and obedience to God, his Soule had a proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat part to do which it executed without the Body: as <hi>to conceave &amp; meditate</hi> on the will of God revealed to him, <hi>to love</hi> and <hi>wholly to imbrace</hi> it, and <hi>to purpoſe</hi> the full performing of it, &amp;c. His Body alſo had a proper and externall vſe, not onely <hi>to follow</hi> the holy thoughts and purpoſes of his minde, but alſo <hi>to minister</hi> many outward occaſions, &amp; <hi>to derive them</hi> to the minde, whereby Chriſt wrought righteouſnes compleatly, and in his whole man.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3239:28"/>That which was by cooperation and mutuall cohaerence only of one part with the other, as it was a diſtinct kinde of working in the Soule and in the body alſo, ſo it was reſpected ſecondarily, and only becauſe the true conſtitution of our nature requireth ſo: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Chriſt meant wholly and perfitly to take vpon him. Whence now we may well argue, <hi>As it was with him touching his faculty of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſnes and Obedience, ſo it was and ought to bee touching his ſuffering Gods puniſhments for vs.</hi> There is no reaſon in the world, nor likelyhood, that the natural faculty in Chriſts Soule of <hi>proper and immediat ſuffering</hi> for our ſinnes ſhould have no vſe, and a Suffering of paines onely by and from the body ſhould be ſufficient, when in his <hi>doing of righteouſnes for vs</hi> his Soules ioint Obedience and mutually knit togeather in &amp; with his Body was not alone ſufficient. <hi>But there was further obedience found in the Soule of Christ, even that which was proper and immediat in it,</hi> as before I ſaid. Seeing then ſuch a kind of Obedience was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for vs in Chriſts Soule, <hi>therefore ſuch a Suffering alſo even in the ſame kinde was neceſſary likewiſe.</hi> This muſt needs be a perfit rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for vs againſt you, except you could by expreſſe Scripture diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this proportion of like neceſſity betweene the operation of the proper faculties of Chriſtes Humane Soule, that is betweene his <hi>Doing</hi> &amp; <hi>Suffering</hi> for vs: which you ſhall never be able to do. And thus it appeareth I hope, that you had no cauſe ſo cruelly to rage at me for this as you do.</p>
            <p>Nor yet for the next: where your charge me that<note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 250.</note> I conclude Chriſts fleſh <hi>to be needles for our redemption.</hi> A horrible Haereſie. But how do I ſay ſo much? Becauſe I ſay, <hi>His Soules ſuffering by Sympathy did not make properly to our redemption.</hi> Ergo <hi>his Fleſh was needles.</hi> I deny this ſequele: how can that follow? Touching the ſenſe of my ſpeach, you may remember how I have largly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> before that the Soules <hi>proper</hi> ſuffering is greatly and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed from the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſuffering that is by ſympathy: And that the Soules ſuffering by Sympathy in Chriſt was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God, by reaſon that our naturall conſtitution doth require it ſo to be in every true and perfit man, which Chriſt alſo was. And thus it did make to our redemption, even as likewiſe his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Affections: as his Wearines, Hunger, Sleepe, Feare, Love, Ioy, &amp;c. Theſe doe make to our redemption, not as intended in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3239:29"/>Chriſts incarnation <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>primarily,</hi> but <hi>ſecondarily</hi> and <hi>by conſequent;</hi> becauſe that Humane nature which God ordayned vnto him, and intended to be perfit in him, could not otherwiſe be throughly perfit as it is in vs; but with theſe common Affections &amp; infirmities w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> other mortall Creatures have to, &amp; not Man only. Alſo in Chriſt theſe Infirmities and Affections wrought not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly</hi> for ſinne: but vſually for other particular cauſes and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions <hi>immediatly.</hi> Nevertheles they were all even for ſin in him <hi>conſequently,</hi> that is becauſe the perfection of Humane nature, which he aſſumed for ſinne, and was in every point in him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I noted, required ſo. Even thus likewiſe in Chriſt: I ſay his Soules ſuffering by ſympathy wrought in him <hi>immediatly &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> for ſome other particular cauſe ſtirring that faculty, that is by reaſon of the Bodily paine &amp; ſmart, which this ſenſitive power of the Soule apprehended &amp; felt and cauſed the fleſh alſo to feele. This ſuffering then of his Soule only by ſympathy was <hi>immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly</hi> not for our redemption from ſin, but for the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive apprehending of the ſmart, woundes, and blowes, which the Iewes gave his body: &amp; yet as before I ſaid <hi>conſequently</hi> even this was for our ſinne alſo, namely becauſe theſe woundes were given him for our ſinne. And thus, though it made for our redemption in ſuch maner as it wrought in Chriſt becauſe of our ſinne, and as it was intended by Chriſt in taking both partes of our Nature, the Soule &amp; the Body, yet this was not in a <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>immediat</hi> reſpect, and ſo not <hi>properly</hi> but by <hi>conſequent</hi> as I have ſhewed.</p>

Moreover other foule ſinnes, Haereſies, Turciſme, and Atheiſme are committed and determined ſimply in the minde, without any neceſſary imployment of any partes of the Body. As touching Haereſies, to hold <hi>Two first cauſes of thinges a Good and a Bad, God and the Divell</hi> with Manichee: alſo that <hi>Christ the Redeemer was not God</hi> with Arrius: that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt is not God</hi> with Eunomius &amp;c: that <hi>Christ had no Soul</hi> with Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris: that <hi>Chriſtes Manhood was confounded and changed into his Godhead</hi> with Eutyches, or <hi>divided from his Godhead</hi> with Neſtorius: or the opinion of <hi>Vbiquity</hi> or of <hi>Tranſubstantiation.</hi> Finally that <hi>there never was nor ſhalbe any Christ a Redeemer</hi> as the Turkes hold, that <hi>there is no God</hi> as the Atheiſts.

Happily you will ſay, The Soule takes occaſion ſo to thinke by ſome outward bodily thinges before ſeene or heard. I deny not but the Soule taketh occaſion to thinke many things by the bodily ſenſes.

If any will ſtumble on that of Ariſtotle, <hi>Nihil est in intellectû quod non fuit prius in ſenſu,</hi> it is not abſolutly nor vniverſally true. My reaſon is, becauſe Philoſophers thought the minde to be as it were <hi>Tabula abraſa</hi> when we come into the world firſt. They knew not the naturall Pride, the impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and perverſity of mans ſoule, which may yeeld many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Thoughts and Determinations to ſinne, yea <hi>provocations and pleaſures in ſin</hi> which the Body miniſtreth not, neither could the Heathen vnderſtand them. And to ſay that this pride, impiety, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3239:31"/>perverſitie was taken by contagion <hi>from the meere fleſh</hi> originally in Generation, is not to be proved. Bud yet were that ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Soule <hi>afterward</hi> can acte many ſinnes <hi>meerely in it ſelfe</hi> and without the cooperation of the body. Further, as the Angells ſinned in the beginning by their meere ſpirituall conceit againſt God, ſo nothing letteth but that man in his Angell-like nature (the reaſonable Soule) may ſinne likewiſe without any Bodily meanes therevnto. Alſo, as we can thinke well without vſing our body, God ſo inſpiring vs: ſo may we thinke ill (which is ſinne) our owne inborne corrupt vnderſtanding and reaſon and will moving vs only. Moreover if I grant you this point of Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Philoſophy, that the Soule taketh occaſion to thinke all thinges which ſhe thinketh vniverſally from the body &amp; bodily obiectes: yet it followeth not that ſhe taketh occaſion to misthinke from thence alwayes. The <hi>proper provocations and pleaſures of ſinne</hi> are oftentimes not outward at all: but the meere perverſitie and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of our evill minde is vſually the very cauſe of ill thoughts &amp; ill determinations. I grant alſo that the occaſion is often taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outward ſenſes. But it is meerely taken, not given: taken by the corrupt and perverſe minde, not given by the ſenſes. Which though they be alſo otherwiſe corrupt, yet ſimply in ſeeing natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things they ſinne not, nor yet in hearing, nor in taſting, ſave as the minde which is properly, and principally, and firſt ſinfull, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth their operation.

As well you may ſay, There were none ſaved til Chriſt was riſen. For ſalvation alſo and forgivenes of ſinnes to all men, came only by the death and reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt. So that thus, till Chriſt came in the fleſh, none of the holy Patriarkes, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, David,</hi> and the reſt, obtayned eternall life. And what became of them then? But I am perſwaded, that <hi>Abraham, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and all the Prophetes dying before Chriſt was exhibited in the fleſh, yet by their faith in Gods ſure ordinance and promiſe, they had and enioyed Chriſt truely incarnat, ſlaine, and riſen againe: and this to them was as effectuall then, as it is now to vs ſince the actual performance of theſe things.

Wherefore I muſt needs think that as Satan was a ſubtil Spirit, ſo he could &amp; did ſometime ſpiritually ſuggeſt temptations into Chriſtes heart, and Chriſt could in Soule conceave them, and yet vtterly without all ſin: which we at no hand now can doe, becauſe we are all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apt and inclining to evill, as Chriſt was not.

I pray what oddes is this, that you make betweene the inward and outward temptations? It is true, this is one good vſe of both theſe fortes in the godly, in whom Chriſt hath ſanctified all afflictions, &amp; death it ſelfe. Yet in their very nature they all are none other but partes of Gods Curſe for ſin, very puniſhments of ſinne, and true effects of Gods wrath: as in Chriſt they were all.

Extraordinarily and ſingularly by Gods owne ſpeciall ordinance Chriſt was even thus puniſhed, yet where ſin was but imputed.

Wherefore this work of Chriſt at this time performed and wrought by him,<note place="margin">Note.</note> is by a proper and peculiar Name iuſtly called his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> not not his <hi>Compaſſion.</hi> Againe you ſay, <hi>For their ſakes Moſes deſired to be wiped out of Gods booke, and Paul could have wiſhed him ſelfe to bee ſeparated from Christ for his brethren the Iſraelites.</hi> Ergo Chriſt at his Paſſion was caſt into that ſtrange Agonie for the griefe of their reiection. This alſo hath no ſhape of any reaſon in it. It proveth that Chriſt ſurely had very great pity and commiſeration of them, but nothing els in the worlde. Beſides Chriſt might have far greater pity of them, then Moſes or Paul had, and yet hee was able to cary his affection far more patiently and quietly then they were able: which would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepe him from ſuch an outwarde diſtemper as was even in them.

Thus here is no ſemblance of reaſon in this for your purpoſe. But againſt you heere are 4. worthie things to be noted. If we conſider this firſt, that theſe moſt ſervent deſires of theſe rare men, were holy and not ſinful. Becauſe their thoughts being wholly &amp; alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather for the time defixed on their love to their Brethren in the fleſh that they might be ſaved, and that Gods glory might be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly more ample, if he ſaved ſo many hundred thouſands (which now almoſt ſeemed to them as loſt) then it would be in their own particular ſalvation onely: and thus for the tyme not thinking (it ſeemeth) vpon their own immutable Election and Salvation not any thing els, ſaving only that they could deſire their brethrens ſalvation yea though it were with their owne damnation for their ſakes, if ſo it might ſtand with Gods will, which no doubt alwayes they implyed, though expreſſed nor: thus I take it plaine enough that theſe ſinned not in this their deſire, and I ſuppoſe you take it ſo too, in that you alleage them &amp; ground your reaſon of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon vpon them.

Howe much more likely is it then that Chriſt the very rock of all ſtrength and fountaine of patience, would not thus ſeeme affrighted and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and ſo wofully behaving him ſelfe for his meere bodily death, and that before it came vnto him. All your anſwer is, that this is <hi>no fit compariſon</hi> for the Sonne of God: for they are deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not having any feare or care of God till they feele the force of his wrath in Hell fyre. What an anſwer is this? They have no feare nor care of God. What then? Yet naturally they have feare and care of moſt bitter paines, and namely then when they feele them. If you ſay, before they feele them they are ſo deſperate and ſo hardened by Satan, that they care not for any tormentes: that in deed is commonly true. But what will you or can you alleage to hinder their full and moſt dreadfull ſenſe of them, when they are in them? Satan wiſheth them not ſo much good as to benumme them now in their ſenſes, ſo that the cruell paines of death ſhould not trouble them in the time of their death, which hee would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make more fearfull and intollerable vnto them. Let them be then in their life time as <hi>desperat</hi> as they will, yet in death and in the middeſt of moſt horrible tortures which oftentimes very qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly they indure, ſurely they cannot chooſe but feele as liuely and as <hi>perfitely</hi> as other men doe. Only it is a naturall boldnes and ſtrength of minde (in it ſelfe no diſcommendable propertie) that ſuſtayneth them in ſuch extreme paines: One inſtance for all may ſerve in this kinde, even that wretched Murderer of the Prince of Orange in Netherland.

You tell vs of the effect which he perfourmed which we gladly acknowledge: viz. that Chriſt did this in deed by his death, he made our death ſince to be no Curſed death, but a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death. But how did he this, by ſuffering nothing but his meere
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3239:52"/>bodily death only, or alſo a Religious feare of Hell? All which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godly men doe alſo ſuffer and feele, which they take paſſing ioyfully and quietly. But thus Chriſt did not ſeeme to doe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed did he in his Agonie. Or did Chriſt ſuffer ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſorrow? You ſay, <hi>The death which Christ ſuffered when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched came fast clasped with Hell.</hi> What meane you by that? meane you, that Death and Hell both alike came iointly vpon Chriſt, and that both iointly were ordayned of God to ſeaze vpon him? Then it is theſame that wee affirme. Otherwiſe how came they <hi>clasped togeather</hi> againſt him? By breaking the knot betwixt Death and Hell, he could not be ſo wofully affected and afflicted above meaſure as he was, if he did not ſuffer by them ſomewhat extraordinarily. Vnto this you have nothing to anſwer. Only you ſay, <hi>he ſevered them,</hi> and <hi>none ells but only the Sonne of God could diſſolve them.</hi> Which we deny not. Neither can we ſee how Death by Gods ordinance might ſeaze vpon Chriſt, and not the paines of Hel: ſeeing neither of them is in themſelves ſin, but both alike are the due vengeance of ſinne which he was ordayned to ſuffer ſo far as was poſſible. Why then did he ſuffer the one, and not touch the other. Neither yet do you ſhew that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you take in hand heere, how <hi>bodily death is contemptible to the Godly which was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to God himſelfe</hi> by your aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It was not therefore that onely, but ſome other death farre more dreadful and intollerable, which made Chriſt man (being alſo God) in ſuch wiſe to tremble and quake. In deed <hi>Christ had farre greater cauſe</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>to feare even his bodily death, then any of his Members have.</hi> For it was therefore <hi>becauſe death approched vnto him clasped fast with Hell,</hi> ſo that he could not by the ordinance of God meddle with one but he muſt feele the other. And thus he did not <hi>contemplate</hi> and looke on them a farre of, nor had to doe with one more then the other, but by ſuffering one, he felt both: and by induring one, he indured both. And thus in deed Chriſt was left by God to the full naturall ſenſe of his bodily torments. But the Godly and the Martyrs deale only with bodily Death; the paines of Hell, or of Gods wrath they feare not, becauſe they know by Chriſtes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame they are aboliſhed, &amp; removed farre from them.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3239:53"/>they deale not with Bodily death wholely and naturally: for they have Gods comfort with them to mitigate it, which Chriſt nowe felt not. Yea they mind not their paines very much for their great hope and ioy preſenly following: but this was all overclowded in Chriſt at this inſtant. Therefore he had exceeding great cauſe to be affrighted and terrifyed &amp; to cry out with bitter teares, though the godly have cauſe to triumph &amp; ſing in Death.

For then doubtles it was for the infinite
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3239:55"/>paines which now he felt in our ſteed, that he ſo cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> Otherwiſe if you thinke they meant that Chriſt ſpake this by ſome ſtrange <hi>Metonimy,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him ſelfe but meaning his Church: that can have no good ſenſe. For how can it be that <hi>we were forſaken of God</hi> when Chriſt was on the Croſſe. Nay, even there and then <hi>were we</hi>
               <note n="“" place="margin">Act. 20</note> 
               <hi>purchaſed vnto God,</hi> not forſaken by God. Againe your owne rule is, which I like well, that no Figure is to bee admitted in Scripture where there is no ill nor hurtfull ſenſe following literally. But I have ſhewed a little before a plaine, eaſie, and Chriſtian ſenſe heereof, taking it literally: that <hi>me</hi> ſignifieth Chriſtes owne perſon name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Manhood bearing nowe, as our Suretie, intollerable paines inflicted by Gods wrath vpon him: and ſo he may mourne &amp; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe that he was <hi>forſaken,</hi> that is <hi>left in vnmeaſurable paines with out feeling of any comfort</hi> or ſuccour for the tyme. Wherefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor any of the Fathers ought to conceave that <hi>me</hi> heere ſhould ſignifie not Chriſt properly, but the Church Figurativelie. What other conſtruction you can make heereof, I can not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. Finally, this 1. ſenſe is contrary to your 2. and 3. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: alſo to your 5. and 6. ſenſes. If eyther of theſe be taken as the true meaning of this place, it cannot poſſibly ſtande with the reſt: although you allow them all, as by and by we ſhall manifeſtly ſee. Now then your ſenſe, what is it? Even this, that Chriſts humane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nature was left helples to the rage of the Iewes; which is a kinde of forſaking. This ſeemeth to come neereſt indeed to your liking, by that which I obſerve in<note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 13</note> you. But as I ſaid, this is directly contrary to your 1. ſenſe, &amp; to the reſt following. Alſo<note n="b" place="margin">Heere 11.50.</note> before we ſaw how greatly Chriſtes ſufferinges ſpecially on the Croſſe differed from ſuch, as the godly doe alſo ſuffer. Yea there is ſurely no reaſon nor ſhew of reaſon, that Chriſt heere ſhould ſo mournfully and ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably complaine that God had <hi>forſaken him,</hi> if it were only but for ſuch diſtreſſes as the godly alſo doe equally ſuffer at the hands of evill men. Seeing moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the hower of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms doe never vtter any ſuch ſhew (as Chriſt heere did) of a minde vncomforted. Where alſo note this well, that no godly man not Martyr did ever aſcribe this forſaking of themſelves to God in the time of their martyrdomes. For though then they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with greater violence of bodily enemies, yet they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3239:56"/>with far greater abundance of heavenly comfort, even in the middeſt of the paines of death. So that they never mourne nor complaine at ſuch extreme dealing, as Chriſt now did, when hee ſaid <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me.</hi> Wherefore it is a great ſhame to imagine that Chriſt was leſſe able to indure ſuch a dereliction, or that he would thus complaine and mourne for it only.<note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> The bare names againe of c <hi>Austin, Ambroſe, Hierom</hi> doe heere likewiſe no good. This is but a weake kind of reaſoning for ſo learned a Divine as you are. Although alſo theſe very ſentences of the Fathers I can eaſily admit, if they import no more then they ſeeme: namely that theſe outward afflictions on the Croſſe were ſome cauſe (and that not ſmall) of his complaint, alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that ſome greater cauſe alſo did concurre &amp; was conioyned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with them.

Only graunt this plainly, that Chriſt ſuffered in his ſoule the true effects of Gods proper Iuſtice or wrath: and we ſeeke no more. Graunt this I ſay, and then we will ſee further (if you will make it a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) whether the ſenſe of payne in Chriſt was leſſer for the time, then that which is eternall in the damned: and whether the true and proper wrath of God taking full vengeance of ſinne heere in this world, might not be as ſharpe and violent as the ſharpeſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hell, yea the very ſhame which is in Hell the ſharpeſt. Truely, though Chriſt ſuffered all (which hee did ſuffer) heere in this world, yet for any thing I can ſee, there is cauſe why Chriſt ſhould be an Extraordinarie perſon in the caſe of Suffering for ſinne in this life: and that therfore, as touching ſorrow and paine, he might feele more then ever any els hath or could feele for the time. You ſeeme to graunt vnto Chriſt<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 2</note> 
               <hi>all naturall ſorrowe and feare.</hi> Neither doe wee ſeeke any more. But <hi>you trust the payne of the Damned is more then a naturall oppreſſing and afflicting of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3239:62"/>heart with humane feare &amp; ſorrow.</hi> Forſooth it is not. It is no more then a very <hi>natural humane</hi> ſorrow &amp; feare. It proceedeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly and principally from God him ſelfe: who is the <hi>Nature of natures.</hi> Alſo <hi>Humane nature</hi> is apt to receyue ſuch ſorrow &amp; fear from him. Thus the very paynes of the Damnedare meerely <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</hi> Yet <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> I graunt they are, if we meane this, that they are aboue our natures ſtate to beare or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend them.

Therefore never skoffe at it, nor reproch it, nor wreſt it. We ought not to bee aſhamed to acknowledge that weaknes of Humane nature in Chriſt, which Chriſt was not aſhamed of for our ſakes to vndergo. If this could not be poſſibly in Chriſtes Manhood without ſin, then I were a wretch to affirme ſo much of him; eſpecially ſtil to affirm it. But if it be poſſible by any means, thorow the meere inſtinct of mans Nature, (as it is Gods creature and free from all ſinne) thus to ſpeake and to wiſh ſuddainly, and ſuddainly to controll it againe, as Chriſt did: then what minde beare you, and how may we iudge of this your ſtriving, which is not to cleare Chriſt from all ſinne in his Agonie. For that we doe all, and Nature it ſelfe witneſſeth with vs that in ſuch a caſe as he now was in, this was nothing ſtrang to be thus perplexed, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But your ſtriving ſeemeth to be altogither to exempt Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from our meere naturall affections and infirmities: and to give him Humane fleſh indeed, but not ſuch as ours is in all and every point, except onely ſinne. You will ſay, If hee knew it to be Gods will and prayed againſt it, how could he want ſinne? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, He knew it; but at this inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered it not, he thought not on it: and ſo his ſuddaine deſire may bee cleere from ſinne. But why thought hee not on it? or how could hee chooſe but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3239:62"/>think on that which he well knew, and did ſo greatly concerne him?

And thus for the very ſuddaine he might not think at all vpon Gods will, and his owne certaine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſuffer this very ſame, or that he was to ſuffer it longer: but only on the intolerablenes of the paines and wo, which inſtantly he felt. Now Natures very inſtinct is, in ſuch dolours to wiſh and deſire eaſe, and the more vehemently it is pinched, the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly it deſireth: and this is Gods owne gift and workmanſhip in nature, and ſimply thus to deſire, is in this reſpect truly to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned Gods owne expreſſe will. And thus for the ſuddaine <hi>not remembring, nor thinking</hi> on Gods particular will otherwiſe, but feeling the inſtinct of nature in ſuch a caſe only wiſhing eaſe to it ſelf, he prayeth rightly <hi>That this Hower &amp; This Cup might paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</hi> Wherein yet I ſay he prayeth in one reſpect againſt Gods known wil, but in an other reſpect even according to his will.

Laſtly it was contrary in the outward words, &amp; in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection of his minde <hi>now</hi> wanting this <hi>remembrance:</hi> but it was fully and wholy according to Gods will in the generall diſpoſition of his minde and whole man.

Neither is this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar contrariety to Gods will any ſinne, namely when by Gods own ordinance we know not what Gods ſpecial will is, ſo that we alwayes remaine apt &amp; ready therevnto when we know it.

Yet he prayed well and rightly according to God will in natures affection, ſeeing hee knew not Gods ſecret will to the contrary, neither was to have knowne it before the event. And thus likewiſe ſtood the caſe with Chriſte at this ſeaſon. His ſuddaine <hi>Not remembring</hi> Gods particular will (by reaſon of his fearfull aſtoniſhment) was all one as if he had not known it at all (yea thus alſo he ought not to haue knowen it) for that inſtant.

Heerein ſtood the difference: Balaam then knewe Gods will was otherwiſe, at that tyme when he inclined after his owne minde.

Therefore Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams deſire though Conditionall and with reſervation (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) of God will, was nevertheles wicked and againſt God: his

Yea, in this caſe when we perfitly know and remember Gods certaine will, every light affection and ſuddaine wiſhing to the contrary, (howſoever <hi>conditionally</hi>) is no leſſe then manefeſt ſinne againſt God. But in David and Chriſt heere the caſe is not ſo, as before I noted.

Thus my meaning is that the nature of <hi>eulabia</hi> admitting the ſenſe ſom time of <hi>Feare</hi> properly, admitteth heere this ſenſe, yea of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie it muſt admit it for the reaſon noted aboue.

This he may withall (I grant) inſinuat: yet the other proper feare &amp; grievous dread muſt needs be admitted.

We may conſider alſo that this word heere <hi>the deepe</hi> many times is referred to the vaſt Gulfes &amp; deepe pits of the earth, and likewiſe to the vnknowen, deepe, and furtheſt partes of the ſea. Now the Apoſtle may ſeeme to vſe this large ſignifying word of purpoſe to expreſſe the infinit ſearching about of an incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and comfortles minde which ſeeketh iuſtice before God by the keeping of the Lawe.

For having ſome Spirituall doctrine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver and the ordinary ſpeach wanting ſome fit word for the ſame, then they might, yea of neceſſity they were forced to take ſome word neereſt in nature and ſenſe to their purpoſe, &amp; ſo they might give to that word a peculiar Eccleſiaſticall vſe further then anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently it had. But <hi>Hades</hi> for Hell hath no help by this reaſon: they tooke the word <hi>Gehenna</hi> from the Hebrewes, and vſed it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Hell. Therefore they need not alter <hi>hades</hi> for that purpoſe, for which they had another proper word. It is manefeſt then that the Apoſtles ſtil kept the proportion of the ſenſe in all their words tranſlated from the common and vſuall ſpeach of the Heathen ſo far as any reaſon of truth might be alike in both, &amp; ſo they ſpake indeed ſtill <hi>the tounge and language of the Nations:</hi> and therefore <hi>Hades</hi> with the Apoſtles can not be properly <hi>Hell,</hi> as even with Heathens alſo properly it was never.</p>

<list>
                  <item>1. This writing touching <hi>Thad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daeus</hi> brought by <hi>Euſebius</hi> from <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Judas</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (who ſent this <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> being one of the 70. Diſciples) was the ſame who is called alſo <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe ſheweth that <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> were 2. divers and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Apoſtles. Therefore this writing is falſe.</item>
                  <item>2. Heere alſo we may probably conceave an other errour; that this <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> (one of the 70.) ſeemeth to be miſtake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this Syria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> writing for <hi>Thad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> one of the 12. Apoſtles.</item>
                  <item>3. Further this counterfait <hi>Thad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> was content to receave (and did receave) even from a King him ſelfe, and alſo (as it ſeemeth) from one of his Nobles, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and worſhip. Whereas the true ſervants of Chriſt <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the <hi>Angell</hi> refuſed vtterly the ſame in ſuch very maner offered vnto them by meaner perſons in reſpect of ſtate. Therefore this <hi>Thaddaeus,</hi> if he were any, was ſome falſe Apoſtle, and came not by Chriſtes ſending, but led by the ſpirit of errour and ſeduction: as ſome were, who went abroad in the name of Diſciples and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in thoſe dayes.</item>
                  <item>4. Neither doe I ſee how it can poſſibly be true which this <hi>Thaddeus</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt <hi>aſcended vp to his Father with a great multitude:</hi> ſeeing the Scripture ſheweth how after 40. dayes (the tyme that he converſed with his Apoſtles) hee aſcended in all their ſightes, alone vp into Heaven.</item>
